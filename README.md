## Framework

We developed the project according to the ideas of *front-end and back-end separately*, and used JSON string to interact between them. The following is their respective introduction.

#### Front-end

You can find all codes of Front-end in folder *web*. We developed them using html+css+js, so that you should deploy them on a static web server. For more information, please read web/README.md.

#### Back-end

All files of back-end are in the folder *API*. Most of them are PHP files, so that you should deploy them on a PHP server, and the version should be higher than 7.3. We try to use simple internal functions, so theoretically it can run with excellent compatibility on most PHP server.

We created a framework named ThinkerAPI to develop the Back-end. To learn more, you can read the file API/Readme.md.

## Interaction

To understand the interaction method between front-end and back-end, please read API/README.md and web/README.md.

## Framework
We developed this project following the idea *separation of front and back end*, using JSON string to interact between them. The following is their respective introduction.

#### Front-end

You can find all codes of Front-end in folder *web*. We developed them in html+css+js, so that you should deploy them on a static web server. For more information, read web/Readme.md.

#### Back-end

All files of back-end are located in the folder *API*. Most of them are PHP files, so that you should deploy them on a PHP server, which version should upper than 7.3. We try to use simple inside-function so theoretically it could run on most PHP server with great compatibility.

We created a framework named ThinkerAPI to develop the Back-end. To learn more information, you can read the file API/Readme.md.

## Interaction

To learn the method of interaction between front-end and back-end, read API/README.md and web/README.md.

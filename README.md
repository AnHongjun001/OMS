## Framework
We followed the idea *separation of front-end and back-end* to develop this project.

* Back-end

All codes of Back-end are in folder *API*. Most of them are PHP files, so that you should deploy them on a PHP server, which version should upper than 7.3. 

We created a framework named ThinkerAPI to develop the Back-end. To learn more information, you can read the file API/Readme.md.

* Front-end

In folder *web*. We developed by html+css+js, so that you should deploy them on a static web server. For more information, read web/Readme.md.

## Interaction
We made an agreement used for interaction between front-end and back-end.

* Request

Front-end send an POST request to ask for some information.
